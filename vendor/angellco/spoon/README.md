# Spoon

Enhance your Matrix with groups, tabs and more!

![Icon](resources/img/banner.png)

Use Spoon to group Matrix blocks, hide blocks and / or fields, and organise your block layouts with tabs.

Spoon never touches your content, it is simply a layer on top of the core Matrix field type, so if you ever don’t want it you can just take the blue pill and uninstall it.

Or is the red pill. Which is the real illusion?!

**Beware this is beta-ware!**

Currently your groups and tabs are limited to the global context, but in the future I will bring in support for Entry Types, Category Groups and more like in the good old days.

See the [roadmap](#roadmap) for progress.

**Pricing:** this plugin will be paid for when it is released onto the plugin store, how much is as yet undecided.

This project used to live under a [different name](https://github.com/angell-co/Pimp-My-Matrix) in Craft 2, but I renamed it for obvious reasons.

Big thanks to the lovely people at [Supercool](https://github.com/supercool) for letting me take this project over.
