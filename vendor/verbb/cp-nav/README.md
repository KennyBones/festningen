<img width="500" src="https://verbb.io/uploads/plugins/cp-nav/_800x455_crop_center-center/cp-nav-social-card.png">

Control Panel Nav is a Craft CMS plugin to help manage your Control Panel navigation. Take control over your Craft CMS control panel navigation with CP Nav. Rename, reorder, hide and show menu items in the control panel. You can even add your own custom menu items for external links, or commonly used URLs within Craft.

## Download

While Craft 3 is still in beta, you'll need to use Composer to download and install the plugin.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require verbb/cp-nav

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for CP Nav.
